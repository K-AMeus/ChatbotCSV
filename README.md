# ChatbotCSV

At the time of ChatbotCSV's development, no publicly accessible AI tools existed for analyzing text from PDF files. This innovation earned ChatbotCSV 3rd place in the University of Tartu's student project competition.

ChatbotCSV is an AI-based tool designed to democratize access to legal information contained within the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, this tool can interpret and answer a wide range of questions related to Estonian laws. Built with Python, it utilizes LangChain for AI model interaction and Pinecone for efficient data management, making legal information accessible to everyone, regardless of their legal expertise.
